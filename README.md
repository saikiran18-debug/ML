# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
The Stock Price Prediction project focuses on forecasting the future prices of stocks using machine learning techniques. The project leverages historical stock data to train predictive models that can provide insights into future price trends.

## Objectives
- To predict the closing price of a stock based on historical data.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models.
- To provide a tool that can assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Data Source
- Historical stock price data sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) (or another reliable source).
- The dataset includes features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (optional): Deep learning models.

## Models Implemented
1. **Linear Regression**: A simple model to establish a baseline.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy.
3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning model suitable for time-series data.
4. **ARIMA**: A statistical method tailored for time-series forecasting.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and time-series splitting.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating lag features, moving averages, and other indicators.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to assess model performance.

## Insights
- The LSTM model outperforms traditional machine learning models in capturing complex patterns in stock price data.
- Feature engineering, including the use of technical indicators, significantly enhances prediction accuracy.
- The model's predictions can be visualized alongside actual prices to analyze performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in financial forecasting. While the models provide valuable insights, they also highlight the inherent unpredictability of stock markets.

## Future Work
- Explore the impact of external factors such as news sentiment and economic indicators.
- Implement a real-time prediction system with live data feeds.
- Experiment with advanced deep learning models and hyperparameter tuning.
